# IoT LightBulb
By Ricky Palaguachi.

## Information
This project was created as a part of a Networking course.
The goal was to anonymously pair up students to design and develop a networking protocol to control a Smart Lightbulb.
Each student created a Client app to control the Lightbulb and a Server app to receive instructions and update the state of the lightbulb.
The Lightbulb was simulated in Terminal.
